# About Me
Hello! My name is Amy and I am from Dallas, Texas. I am a senior studying environmental health, but I also have other interests in languages, ceramics, sciences, and dance. I studied abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Accra, Ghana. I traveled and learned about different parts of the world and how culture can shape different view points and opinions. I do not know exactly what I want to do with my life yet, but surprisingly I am not as nervous about it as I used to be. **Bring it on future!**
